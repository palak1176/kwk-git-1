<p class="paragraph1">Hi, I am Palak! I am from Cumming, Georgia. I am currently a data collection and 
    structuring intern at Syensqo, a multinational material science company. I am super excited to start 
    at Georgia Tech to pursue a major in industrial engineering with a concentration in data analytics 
    and science this fall! Some of my hobbies include listening to music, hanging out with my friends and
    taking pictures on our digicams, diamond painting, and playing card games.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Kode With Klossy: Web Development Camp</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I learned how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and then worked with a team 
        of 4 peers to design and develop a minimum viable product (MVP) for a website offering resources 
        and guidance on stress management using the skills I learned during the camp! </p>

    <h3 class="h3">CS1301: Introduction to Computing</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I took CS1301 through Georgia Tech's Distance Learning program and learned 
            the basics of Python such as functions, conditionals, error handling, and file input/output. </p>

    <h3 class="h3">Kode With Klossy: Data Storytelling Challenge</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Since I am interested in working with data in the future, I figured this 
            program would be a great fit and I am so happy I applied! I have already learned so much 
            about GitHub and Command Line, things I had heard so much about but was always too overwhelmed 
            to explore.</p>
